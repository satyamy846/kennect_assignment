JWT stands for JSON web token whereas JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation.
JWT is basically used to transfer the information in a secure way over the web. It can be used for an authentication system and can also be used for information exhange.
There are three components-: 1. Header
                             2. Payload
                             3. Signature
JWT example -:  header:{
                          "alg": "H3443",   (Where alg is algorithm is used for encryption)
                          "typ" : "JWT"     (Where typ is type of header this information contains)
                       }
                payload{
                        "id": 123454,
                        "name": "Satyam"
                       }
                signature {
                            secret: satyamy846
                          }
                          
Benefits of using JWT-: 1. JWT works on stateless authentication mechanism as they do not store state in database so it is more secured.
                        2. JWT allow for more granual access model like who can have access to each part of the system as well as what they can do with that access.
                        3. JWT is compact because its size can be sent through an URL, or inside HTTP header.Thers are three parts in it header,payload,and signature
                        Whereas header in a JWT is mostly used to describe the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT like signing/decryption technique used on it.
                        Payload is use to store all the user's data, and anyone can have access to this.
                        Where Signature is third party JWT and used to verify the authenticity of token.
